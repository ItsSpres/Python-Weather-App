#  üêç Python Weather App

This weather app is a college project. It simply makes an API call and returns the weather on the inputted location. However, I also decided to use **[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)** which is a Python GUI toolkit. 

# Setup

- Get API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- Don't forget to add your API key to the config file.
